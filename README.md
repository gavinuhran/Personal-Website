# Personal Website
## Created by Gavin Uhran
### Description
A repository of the code and files that together create my personal website. The website serves as an online portfolio to display my programming projects. The website always displays my skills at creating a website from scratch using HTML/CSS and Django. The website is live at www.gavinuhran.com.

### Programming the Website
The website was coded using the **Django** web framework. Django provided excellent administrative controls, as well as accessibility managing URLs and models. 

Most of my time was spent programming the **HTML** and **CSS** templates, two languages I previously did not have much experience working with. Implementing **Bootstrap**, a front-end framework, helped me design the layout of my website.

### Future Improvements
Currently, the host I used to deploy my website to www.gavinuhran.com does not display images as it should. Moving forward, I will most likely switch to another host, or implement Amazon Web Services online S3 storage to store the images.
